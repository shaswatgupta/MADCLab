<p><b>About Us: </b>We are the Multi-Agent and Distributed Computing Laboratory and we proudly call ourselves the MADClab. MADCLab is inspired by the research challenges of simulating a human like society into a world of software agents and also modelling and simulation of real world problems by these software agents. Our group is broadly focused on research areas related to Distributed Artificial Intelligence (Multi-Agent Systems), Distributed Computing and Semantic Web. Within these our prime focus is on various issues related to the field of Multi-Agent Systems, issues like Team formation, Decision making, Agent Learning, Agent to Agent interaction or Human to agent interaction etc.We want all these operations to be held semantically, i.e. in as close a relation with the real world as possible.<p>
